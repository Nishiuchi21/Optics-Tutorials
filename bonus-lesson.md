# Lesson bonus: Spatially overlap two beams

Design an optics scheme to spatially overlap beam from two beams (technique often used to align a guide beam and an infrared beam).

How many mirrors do you need?
How many irises do you need?
What other components do you need? (beam splitter)

Draw a diagram of your design before you build it.

How does your setup change if the beams start parallel versus perpendicular to one another?


## Other questions to think about

1. How do you know if your beam is collimated?
2. How can you collimate a beam?
3. How do you know if the beam is parallel to the optical rail?
4. Is it ever ok to bend down close to the optics table to check where the beam is going?
5. How can you align a beam that you canâ€™t see?
