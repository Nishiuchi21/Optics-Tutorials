# Lesson 1 — Basic Optical Elements and Beam Alignment

**Goals**
1. Learn basic optics components (laser, mirrors, irises, posts, etc.)
2. Basic mirror alignment using a red guide beam, two mirrors, and two irises.



## Mirrors
- Beam should hit close to the center (so there is room for adjustment later)
- Do not touch the mirrors (a laser can burn organic molecules, which can damage the mirror or mirror coating)
- Do not blow on the optics
- Handle the mirrors using a mirror mount as much as possible (not with your hands)

## Mirror holders
- Use knobs to make tiny adjustments in z and y

## Irises
- Irises help align beam in correct direction at correct height
- Once you align the beam, don’t touch the iris
- Irises also block scattered light
- Use a collar or the post lock (on some ThorLabs post holders) in the post holder to fix the iris height.

## Photodetector
- Converts photons into current (semiconductor based)

## Where the lab’s optical components are stored
- metric vs English units

## Alignment — practice 
- Put Mirror 1 close to the laser to limit beam divergence.
- Put Mirror 1 and Mirror 2 close together so we have maximum range of motion for the beam.
- Make the irises as far apart as possible for easier and more precise alignment


## Aligning higher powered beams

The same mirror adjustments can be used to align Class 3 and 4 lasers, but please always follow the guidance from your facility's laser safety officer when using high-power lasers. In many cases, the recommendation is to use low powers for safer handling and to preserve the lifetime of IR cards while aligning free-space and unenclosed laser beams. However, it is important to note that, when the alignment is performed at reduced laser power, the alignment might need to be tweaked once full laser power is applied. 
 
Irises are another special concern while working with high-powered lasers. We used black-plated iris blades (leaves) in the video since our laser power was relatively low. This coating will discolor, and the leaves can deform when higher laser powers are absorbed over long periods. We typically use stainless steel leaves when using higher power lasers to reduce the amount of light that gets absorbed. However, bare stainless steel iris leaves are typically more reflective than the black-plated leaves. When placing irises or any other component in the path, it is also important to check for stray reflections.

Operate the lasers at low powers for safer handling while aligning free-space and unenclosed laser beams. In our videos we have kept our laser power <2 mW by either limiting the laser drive current or including polarizing components in the setup prior to filming. Other ways to limit laser power can include operating a pulsed lasers in CW mode or limiting the pulse repletion rate. If the laser power cannot be reduced, a separate, lower-power laser is often used to perform the initial alignment. When using this approach, the beam from the alignment laser should enter the setup as close as possible to the same position and same angular orientation as the beam from the primary laser. But with both approaches (lowering the laser power or using a secondary aiming laser), the alignment will likely need to be tweaked once full laser power is applied. Please always follow the guidance from your facility's laser safety officer when using high power lasers.
