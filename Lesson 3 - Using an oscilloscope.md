# Lesson 3: Using an oscilloscope

## Functions of an oscilloscope

Graphs a waveform of voltage changing in time. (Voltage axis & time axis)

(A multimeter cannot measure time-dependence)

### Voltage measurements (vertical)
- Voltage peak
- Peak-to-peak
- RMS voltage

### Time & Frequency measurements (horizontal)
- Period
- Pulse width

Many functions to measure a waveform

## Three systems (adjustments)

1. Vertical: adjust attenuation or amplification of the signal. (Volts / division)
2. Horizontal: adjust the time base (time / division)
3. Trigger: stabilize a repeating signal or trigger a single event

### Vertical Controls

* **Position**: move waveform up and down on the screen. Volts-per-division changes waveform size and vertical step divisions on the screen.
* **Coupling**: DC, AC, ground. How to connect an electrical signal between circuits. Input coupling is the connection from the circuit to the oscilloscope. 
    * DC coupling: shows all of the input signal
    * AC coupling: blocks the DC component so the waveform is centered around zero volts (useful if alternating current + direct current is too large for volts/div setting.
    * Ground: disconnects input signal from the vertical system. You can see where zero volts is on the screen.
        * Grounded input coupling & auto trigger mode â€” horizontal line on the screen represents zero volts. Switch from DC to ground and back -> can measure signal voltage level wrt to ground.
* **Bandwidth**
    * Bandwidth limit: limiting the bandwidth reduces the noise on the displayed waveform (can also reduce high frequency portion of the signal)
* Termination
* Offset
* Invert
* Scale

### Horizontal Controls

* **Acquisition**
* **Sampling**: converting part of an input signal into discrete electrical values.
    * A low sample rate compared to the input wave frequency may degrade or distort the sampled signal. In fact, the minimum sampling frequency must be > 2x the maximum frequency component of the signal to avoid artifacts (Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem).
* **Position**: similar to vertical position, but for the time domain. Scale the horizontal divisions with sec/div setting.
* **Trigger position**: the trigger function synchronizes the horizontal sweep at the correct point of the signal for a clear display of the signal.
    * Stabilize repeating waveforms and capture single-shot waveforms.
    * Repetitive waveforms are displayed as static. A poorly triggered signal will result in the sweep starting at different places in the signal.
