# Lesson 5: Etalon fringes and FTIR

Goals:
1. Use new equipment
2. Make an etalon
3. Measure the distance between two mirrors
4. Measure the refractive index of a material inserted between the mirrors
5. Measure the Rabi splitting in a neat liquid and in a diluted liquid


## Part B: Measure fringes

1. Use spacers of three different thicknesses to demonstrate cavity fringes.
2. Calculate the cavity spacing from the fringe spacing.
3. Give each person a different solvent without telling them what they have. Have them try to figure out which solvent they have.
    1. Water: 1.333
    2. Isopropanol: 1.377
    3. Toluene: 1.497

Use peak-finding software.


## Part C: Measure Rabi splitting

1. Use DPPA to measure Rabi splitting
    1. Neat
    2. Diluted in toluene

Fit with a double-Lorentzian function


## Questions

Why is the cavity length different than the spacer thickness?
What do you think contributes to the real cavity length?
Why do you think the refractive index is different from the actual value?
What are the sources of error?
What are the cavity modes, physically?
Why does the spacing change with cavity length or refractive index?

error: take apart cavity and put it back together.
