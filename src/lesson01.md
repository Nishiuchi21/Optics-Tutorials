# Lesson 1: Basic Optical Elements and Beam Alignment

## Goals

1. Learn basic optomechanical components (laser, mirrors, irises, posts, etc.)
2. Basic mirror alignment using a red guide beam, two mirrors, and two irises
3. Basic laser safety 

## Mirrors
- Beam should hit close to the center (so there is room for adjustment later)
- Do not touch the mirrors (a laser can burn organic molecules, which can damage the mirror or mirror coating)
- Do not blow on the optics
- Handle the mirrors using a mirror mount as much as possible (not with your hands)

## Mirror holders
- Use knobs to make small adjustments in x and y

## Irises
- Irises help align beam in correct direction at correct height
- Once you align the beam, don’t touch the iris
- Irises also block scattered light
- Use a collar or the post lock (on some ThorLabs post holders) in the post holder to fix the iris height.

## Photodetector
- Converts photons into current (semiconductor based)

## Where the lab’s optical components are stored
- metric vs English units

## Alignment — practice 
- Put Mirror 1 close to the laser to limit beam divergence.
- Put Mirror 1 and Mirror 2 close together so we have maximum range of motion for the beam.
- Make the irises as far apart as possible for easier and more precise alignment

## Laser Safety (basics)
- Do not look directly into the laser beam
- Do not look at the beam reflection from a mirror
- Do not point the laser at someone else
- Use a laser card when aligning
- Do not bend down to the beam height; always work above the beam height
