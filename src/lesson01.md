# Lesson 1: Basic Optical Elements and Beam Alignment

## Goals

1. Learn basic optomechanical components (laser, mirrors, irises, posts, etc.)
2. Basic mirror alignment using a red guide beam, two mirrors, and two irises
3. Basic laser safety 

## The Basics
### Mirrors
- Beam should hit close to the center (so there is room for adjustment later)
- Do not touch the mirrors (a laser can burn organic molecules, which can damage the mirror or mirror coating)
- Do not blow on the optics
- Handle the mirrors using a mirror mount as much as possible (not with your hands)

### Mirror holders
- Use knobs to make small adjustments in x and y

### Irises
- Irises help align beam in correct direction at correct height
- Once you align the beam, don’t touch the iris
- Irises also block scattered light
- Use a collar or the post lock (on some ThorLabs post holders) in the post holder to fix the iris height.

### Photodetector
- Converts photons into current (semiconductor based)

### Where the lab’s optical components are stored
- metric vs English units

### Alignment — practice 
- Put Mirror 1 close to the laser to limit beam divergence.
- Put Mirror 1 and Mirror 2 close together so we have maximum range of motion for the beam.
- Make the irises as far apart as possible for easier and more precise alignment

### Laser Safety (basics)
- Do not look directly into the laser beam
- Do not look at the beam reflection from a mirror
- Do not point the laser at someone else
- Use a laser card when aligning
- Do not bend down to the beam height; always work above the beam height


## First steps

The first lesson is just practicing aligning using two mirrors and two irises.
Explain the basics of the optics and the laser safety rules.
Then demonstrate how to align the beam using the red laser.
Ask them to try aligning the beam in different ways.
What happens if the irises are close together?
What happens if the mirrors are far from the laser source?
What if the mirrors cannot be adjusted to go through both irises?
Let students *play* with the optics (keeping safety in mind) so they get a feel for how they work.
